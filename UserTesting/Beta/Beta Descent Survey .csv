There was also a small glitch where the graphics changed to low when I tried to change to windowed, but it only happened once. Resolution doesn't seem to change either.","5","Big improvement on the gliding controls, it makes a lot more sense now","5","I love the dark atmosphere. It works well with the lighting. I also like the tombstone and ghost. Very dark :D","4","It's a lot of fun, but it's a bit difficult. It can be frustrating, but I guess that is the case for most platformers.","5","A collectable for replenishing health would be good. 
Audio options would be great too, to mute or lower/raise volume.
A How To Play screen would be good too, explaining the goal to the player. Maybe the Controls menu could be renamed to How To Play, and the objective could be added above the controls.","I think the amount of health left if you reach the bottom should count in some way towards your final score. I'd like to be rewarded for being careful. 
Also, this is a very small thing, but I was hoping I'd be able to walk through the ghost :D","It's looking a lot more like a solid game now. Good job :D"

My highest score was from dodging as many of the floating platforms as I could and gliding at the end to slow momentum and get all the coins at the bottom... feels like cheating","4","a big boobed mentor character

"2024/04/25 11:36:42 pm CET","125 (I know!)","5","The look is great, love the music, the character is pretty cool and the gameplay is simple and effective. ","3","I did not find them very responsive. It was imo very easy to lose control and lose the game without opportunity for recovery. When playing I was hoping I had a little more air control since you are falling for so long. Also, if we are just destined for dead, I would rather lose control of the movement and for the animation to change to full despair. ","5","Awesome, really cool, can't believe you did this in the same time I did mine. ","4","I like all the elements, the jumping and getting the coins and umbrellas. I would have liked a little more contrast when using the umbrella. ","4","Sometimes when we are falling perfectly into the next platform, I already hear the music changing to the losing one, I would allow a little more before changing. ","Maybe a camera that gives you a little more space? Also a bit more headsup with the dissapearing platforms. 
I also notice the platforms kinda move erratically, at least while I was playing (Maybe my video card) so it was hard to get good at it. ","Well done man. "
"2024/04/26 12:16:41 am CET","450","3","Tunnel needs to be longer, umbrella needs to be slower - if there are health pick-ups I never got any of them. I played about 20 games. As the developer you probably think my score is bad because you've played it to death, but there is a disconnect between the umbrella speed and the descent speed - its like the umbrella doesn't slow you at a consistent speed and I think it should. Would make it far easier to pick up points.

I like the intro screen and that you've added graphical settings, I have a very powerful PC and at Ultra settings on 4k it sounded like my PC was about to explode. I have a Master's in game development myself and have worked with Unreal Engine though so I know exactly how it is - very difficult to make the games go easy on people's PC. Never quite got the hang of it myself but something that helped was migrating the project and only taking the necessary files with you, makes the game smaller and easier to work with. Maybe you've already done that though, past that I'm not sure.","4","Controls are fine, just controlling the umbrella is inconsistent.","2","Visuals could use work, I particularly think you need a starting platform and a lever or something to begin the descent, would be nice game feel to pull the lever, have a bit of a free drop and then begin controlling and collecting points.
I like the font.","2","I think you generally fall too fast and the tunnel itself needs to be larger. Make the umbrella halt your speed to a consistent level instead of it being based on how fast your falling velocity was before you pulled it.
I also think those spinning platforms spin too fast but maybe fixing the umbrella will solve that.","3","Health packs - If there are any, I didn't get them.","Just what I've mentioned, it is actually kind of fun like I want to get a better score than 450 but I feel like I'm being punished for using the umbrella.","Good job - keep it up and best of luck with the Masters."

But then maybe I just need to git gud.","5","No problems","5","","","A restart button in game would be nice to save myself the time throwing myself to my death when I miss the first lantern.","",""
"2024/04/26 8:40:48 pm CET","1750","5","It's a very fun and challenging game. Took me a couple of trys to be able to make it to the bottom without dying ","4","The Keyboard and Mouse controls are good and I appreciate the controller input as well. However the player character spins out of control in the air for the first few seconds when trying to use my xbox controller","5","The visuals are nice, and a major improvement from the alpha version. I like the particle effects for collectibles and the area lighting around them as well","5","It's a fun gameplay loop","5","A way to pause the game while playing","","I appreciate the ability to change graphics options and being able to enable vsync. 
However the graphics quality option was blank until I used the arrow buttons to change it "

"2024/04/28 4:01:33 am CET","2000","2","The ultra setting should not use 90% of gpu on a RTX 3070ti, low settings should not use 80-85% of this gpu either. Low settings is like looking at the sun, it blinds you if you look long enough. Control responsiveness is tied to frame rate, meaning don't play on ultra otherwise it's very unwieldy. There was collectables that had solid collision for a split second that stopped movement, probably only the coins, only occurs when collecting at a specific angle, that is directly in line of the edge of the coin. Sound effects sound delayed by a split second whenever an action occurs (i.e landing, umbrella, jumping). Music is good, the distorted audio when falling too much is quite unique.","3","Very floaty. Get even more floaty the less frame rate you have. Spamming the umbrella allows the controls to become more responsive and probably unintended, it makes the game more playable.","3","The visuals were fine, other than the insane amount of motion blur graphics settings above low.","3","Game play is very floaty which become more difficult due to how difficult it is to collect the collectable from the unresponsiveness, which I assume is intended with the theme of madness, however on the gameplay perspective can be frustrating for the play due to lack of control. It is difficult to tell when you will die due to falling. The ghost at the end shouldn't have collision. ","4","No.","Make low settings darker. Make ghost untouchable.

I do think the option thing was odd. Also having the coins at the very bottom seemed odd, very easy to just walk around and grab them. Maybe a timer would be good?"

It might be good if there was some way to recover from a missed jump, like maybe if the umbrella meter recharged a bit while freefalling?","5","More content/levels - maybe powerups or abilities?
