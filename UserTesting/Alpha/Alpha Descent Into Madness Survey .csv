Possibly speed up movement of character while falling on x axis","4","visuals are fine I would add maybe some more visuals on the bottom of the tower as grey floor is bit bland.","3","no","4","I would add maybe something coming from above to kill player(poison loud or something) as if player stays on platform to long as some of platforms below seem to depsawn after certain amount of time otherwise. I would also maybe add something else that can kill player apart from fall damage like a projectile or something. ",""

Putting that job on the player is disorienting for them. A clearer indicator of when you're going too fast would be a big help. The current audio cue is a bit hard to pin down so maybe a more visual cue would work better."

Some platforms span too fast and made me feel sick","4","sometimes the platforms disappeared too quickly","5","Giant floating models of the main character t-posing and floating upwards while you descend",""
"2024/04/08 8:27:12 pm CET","4","It's showing a lot of promise. The music is great and it's a lot of fun trying to land on the platforms and collect stuff. There are a few things missing like a main menu screen and an ending on successful completion of the level","5","Controls are good. There's a bit of a learning curve around the gliding, but otherwise the controls make a lot of sense.","4","Very nice atmosphere, especially with the streetlights lighting up the dark tunnel. The character design is adorable and well done, and the animations are great.","3","The game is a lot of fun. However, currently there is no real game play 'loop', unless you die. If you succeed in making it to the bottom alive, you can run around endlessly, unless you jump into the grave, which instantly kills you :D Also some of the platforms pass through the tunnel walls, out of the level.","5","A main menu when launching the game and a win condition.",""
"2024/04/08 9:10:13 pm CET","4","Looks really good. It's not immediately obvious what's going on. I think it took me dying once or twice to realise I was taking fall damage","4","","5","The visuals look really nice. The character goes really well with the environment and the lighting looks great","3","It's very simple but surprisingly addicting. I think with some more variety it could be really interesting. Maybe powerups or something?","5","Feedback for certain in-game events. While falling, it's difficult to know how much fall damage I was going to take on landing. The music seemed to changed based on how fast I was falling but it didn't feel like there was a direct correlation to fall damage there.

Similarly when I hit the ground too hard it would be good if there was some feedback like a sound effect or animation from the character to show they took damage",""

I really like how the music lends to a sense of urgency.","Not sure, maybe change the timer for the umbrella use, to a color change on the umbrella itself, make it more visual. "
