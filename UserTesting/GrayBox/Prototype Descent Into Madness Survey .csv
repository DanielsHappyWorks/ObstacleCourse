The descending mechanic and character controls feel decent, but there's no clear objective","Some kind of goal/adversity, like maybe enemies or platforms that the player shouldn't land on. Something to give it a bit more strategy",""
"2024/03/03 6:38:45 pm GMT","4","Overall concept is great, just wasn't entirely clear what to do in game.","4","Possible to imploment a zoom-out with camera option, to see level from the side.","4","I like them, though I would say maybe have some design change to the platforms, so it wouldn't feel as monotonous as you go down.","3","I'm interested in seeing what changes will be made as the game progresses.","clear goal for player.","Not really. Maybe a random generator for placing the items, if that isn't planned already?"
"2024/03/03 6:52:57 pm GMT","5","","4","Run and jump controls are standard, though the gliding is difficult to manage.","2","As it's Alice in Wonderland themed, I expect more whimsical and madness in the visuals in later iterations ","3","The concept of the game play is great, but the gliding is difficult, and it's hard to know if you're doing it right or wrong until the health bar is functioning.","The circles (which I'm assuming are pickups) are not working, so the player doesn't know what the purpose of them is. There also isn't a story or goal for the player yet or scores/time limits, so there is currently no real motivation for the player to play the game more than once.",""
"2024/03/03 7:04:44 pm GMT","4","The general concept is interesting. I believe it should be incorporated into the game itself more","3","The glide needs to be fixed, it's at the moment impossible to slow your acceleration","3","Could use more wonderland associated imagery","5","Ended up making my own game of trying to reach the final platform in a single jump so maybe that could be incorporated in some way","A clearer goal needs to be established to keep the player track.","change the starting camera angle to reflect that that platforms are on both the x and z axis. At the moment the starting angle makes the game appear as if it is a 2d platformer"

It depends on when you use the mechanic. It should probably reduce your fall speed by a flat amount rather than multiplying your fall speed. Negative fall speed(jumping) gets multiplied resulting in a super jump, and from the looks of it having a high fall speed doesn't change anything which is probably the max fall speed.","2","There is basically no visuals in the current version. The current visuals is in a sunny atmosphere which does not fit into a descent into madness, it's more of a descent into happiness.","1","You jump the game.","The missing things is everything that's in the concept and not in the current version.","Move the platforms further apart so you actually need to use the umbrella mechanic. Currently the umbrella doesn't even need to be used. Probably add a sense of urgency that forces the player forward so it conveys the ""faster and crazier"" part of the concept."
"2024/03/04 1:34:07 pm GMT","4","","5","","3","visuals should evoke more feelings of madness","2","bit too simple","It could use more decision-making, ie. dodging enemies,
a madness meter, where you lose upon it filling up",""
"2024/03/04 4:50:01 pm GMT","2","not enough really in concept level to get what is mentioned in game design document. I believe some  thing implemented nicely like umbrella, however over all needs more content for me to see concept realised fully which i'm sure will be implemented it future iterations","5","Controls are very good and simple to use.","3","not enough in concept to judge the visual style that user is going for in alice in borderlands. however this is just a concept so is suspected.","3","gameplay loop is described well in the description and in concept the main platform and falling is there which are the key components of the game.","restart option or kill box near bottom for respawn for concept or a simple delta timer for a simple time mechanic. As having to close and relaunch each time to play is annoying","nothing to change as its only concept at moment so will wait for proof of concept prototype to see how its developed further"
"2024/03/04 6:36:52 pm GMT","4","It's an interesting concept and has good potential. I like the concept of the music starting out as a calm jazz score and getting more chaotic as the player descends deeper. ","5","The controls and fairly simple to understand and work just fine. It's nice to be able to pan the camera using the mouse to look around before jumping. ","2","I'm not sure what the two grey bars on the HUD indicate. I assume health and umbrella duration, but does not indicate which is what. ","3","It is missing a death/game over state, if the player falls and misses all the platform, they keep endlessly falling.   ","A way to exit the game without using ALT+F4 or a way to exit fullscreen. ",""
